MCAuth
======

MCAuth is an alternative to the Minecraft.net user authentication system.  It supports the old legacy authentication (pre-1.6) and the new Yggdrasil authentication.  It can optionally contact minecraft.net for unknown logins, skins, and capes.  This compliments MineProxy and my modified Technic Launcher that can proxy Minecraft to this clone.
